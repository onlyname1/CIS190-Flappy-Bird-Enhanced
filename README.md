# Flappy Bird Enhanced

## Description:

This project is a recreation of Flappy Bird with the added element of having to shoot down extra obstacles that will appear between pipes.

## Frameworks and Libraries:

This game will be implemented using SFML. We will also be using the standard library.

## C++ Features and Structure:

We expect to use unique pointers to store the flappy bird, the pipes, and the obstacles that spawn. We will use vectors to store the pipes and the obstacles, and will iterate through them to check for collisions with the flappy bird and its bullets. Since there will be different types of obstacles, we plan on having a base obstacle class and having the different obstacles inherit from the base class. We plan to have a main class which stores all the data and executes the core game logic loop.

## Work Estimate:

* Learning SFML - 5 hours 
* Logic for the Flappy Bird - 1-2 hours 
* Different Obstacle implementations - 2-3 hours 
* Scrolling map and pipes, collisions - 3-4 hours 
* Menu, start button, lose screen - 1-2 hours

## Work Split:

We will be working together on each task.
